Welcome to My project Repo

Currently These are the Projects that I hold in this repo and the use case and the tools Used.

1 - 1. NetflixCloneDevSecOps-PJ3 = This is an fun and Interesting project to learn about multiple tools and how we can configure and securley deploy an application on Kubernetes. 
          Tools used : .
                Github for source code version control.
                Jenkins for CI and CD Pipeline Automation
                Sonarqube for Code Quality Check
                OWASP to helps improve software security
                DOCKER for creating an Image.
                TRIVY for Scanning the file system and Image
                Kubernetes for Deploying the Images as container and orchestrating the version updates and Loadbalancing.
                Prometheus and Grafana for Monitoring 
                Helm for Installing Node Exported on Kubernetes Cluster to Expose the metrics.

2. Aws Infra using IAC ( terraform )  - stepping into IAC Concept, This project automates an 3-tier-web-application ( design provided by AWS in one of the workshops )
               AWS Services Used :
                                 VPC , Subnet , Security Groups , Ec2 Instances , Aurora Mysql Database , S3 Bucket , Loadbalancers, AutoScalling , IAM
               Using Terraform I have deployed an 3-tier-webapplication on AWS cloud , Modulising each component so that each Module can be reused instead of hardcodding each resources.

3. Azure infrastructure using IAC ( Terraform ) - Managing Infrastructure in Azure Cloud using Terraform. - This is an Sample Project to deploy an Vm and File share in A Resoruce Group and to secure the data using a Backup Configuration.
                AZURE Services Used:
                                  Resource Group, Linux Virtual Machines, Vnet , Subnet , Network Security Group , Storage Account with Static website Enabled , Recovery Service Vault, Backup Policies

4. Azure Yaml Pipeline for Infra Automation - Tierd of Using Manual approach in Deploying infrastructure on Cloud ? Try using this Yaml Pipeline to automate the Infrastructure at ease.
                A code commit to an specific branch will trigger the pipeline in Azure Devops Hosted Agent ( linux Vm )
                The Pipeline Have 3 Stages
